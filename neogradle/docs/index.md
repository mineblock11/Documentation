NeoGradle Documentation
=========================

:::caution
Please note that this documentation may not be up to date considering the recent creation of NeoForged.

Until NeoGradle releases its first version, you should refer to ForgeGradle documentation. The ForgeGradle documentation for versions 6 and 5 has been archived here.
:::

This is the official documentation for [ForgeGradle], a [Gradle] plugin for developing [MinecraftForge] and mods using MinecraftForge.

This documentation is _only_ for ForgeGradle, **this is not a Java, Groovy, or Gradle tutorial**.

If you would like to contribute to the docs, read [Contributing to the Docs][contributing].

Adding the Plugin
-----------------

ForgeGradle uses Gradle 8; it can be added using the `plugins` block in the `build.gradle` by adding the following information to the `settings.gradle`:

```gradle
// In settings.gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // ...

        // Add the MinecraftForge maven
        maven { url = 'https://maven.minecraftforge.net/' }
    }
}

plugins {
    // Add toolchain resolver
    id 'org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention' version '0.5.0'
}
```

```gradle
// In build.gradle
plugins {
    // Add the ForgeGradle plugin
    id 'net.minecraftforge.gradle' version '[6.0,6.2)'

    // ...
}
```
